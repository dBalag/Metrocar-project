# Metrocar-project
Metrocar is a ride-sharing company who is seeking to indentify user drop-offs across the stages and plans to implement dynamic pricing to boost revenue during high demand.

-7 FUNNEL STEP QUERY-

The 1st. query summarizes count of users & count of rides x each of the step funnel (the stages that the user does: Download,
Sign-up, Ride Request, Ride Accept, Ride Complete, Payment & Review), x each of the 3 platforms, x 5 age_ranges & x each 
download_date.
Its purpose is to get insights from the step funnel at a deeper level (platforms, age_ranges, download_date).
I used this dataset in Tableau to make viz and being able to answer these business questions:

1. What steps of the funnel should we research and improve? Are there any specific drop-off points preventing users from 
completing their first ride?
2. Metrocar currently supports 3 different platforms: ios, android, and web. To recommend where to focus our marketing budget 
for the upcoming year, what insights can we make based on the platform?
3. What age groups perform best at each stage of our funnel? Which age group(s) likely contain our target customers?
4. What part of our funnel has the lowest conversion rate? What can we do to improve this part of the funnel?

-RIDES REQUESTED X HOUR QUERY-

This query summarizes all the rides has been requested in each hour of the day. 
Its purpose is to summarize x each hour how many rides has been requested, with that then being able to use it in Tableau and viz it to answer the business question: 

1. Surge pricing is the practice of increasing the price of goods or services when there is the greatest demand for them. 
If we want to adopt a price-surging strategy, what does the distribution of ride requests look like throughout the day?.
